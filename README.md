# Andromeda TechConnect

Andromeda TechConnect (ATC) brings people and events together in the tech space. The landing page shows upcoming events and lets users sign up for more information. The admin dashboard simply displays user's names and emails.

ATC was made by a team of designers (Ulysse Worsfold, Shaina Lieh, and Vince Tran) and developers (Tess Bishop, Theodore Pochart, and C. Tavis Post) in a six hour online collabathon at General Assembly.
